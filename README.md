### ðŸ”¸ **About data:**



> The dataset provides a snapshot of a sample Netflix userbase, showcasing various aspects of user subscriptions, revenue, account details, and activity. Each row represents a unique user, identified by their User ID. The dataset includes information such as the user's subscription type (Basic, Standard, or Premium), the monthly revenue generated from their subscription, the date they joined Netflix (Join Date), the date of their last payment (Last Payment Date), and the country in which they are located.



> Additional columns have been included to provide insights into user behavior and preferences. These columns include Device Type (e.g., Smart TV, Mobile, Desktop, Tablet) and Account Status (whether the account is active or not). The dataset serves as a synthetic representation and does not reflect actual Netflix user data. It can be used for analysis and modeling to understand user trends, preferences, and revenue generation within a hypothetical Netflix userbase.
